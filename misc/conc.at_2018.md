## When Fast is Faster than Fastest, Daniel Clifford

* between 2007 and 2012 we used mostly microbenchmarks for testing (useful at
  time, but not anymore)
* in 2012 benchmark Octane was released trying to measure a wider spectre of
  usage
* when measuring real web page runtime breakdowns they discovered that
  relatively little time is spent running Javascript while Octane was measuring
  almost only that
* now try to test more with real web pages
* important lesson: realizing that optimization will lead to optimizing for
  specific goal which might lead to worse behavior for others
	* goal to have consistent baseline performance
* how V8 works
	* V8's ignition interpreter and TurboFan optimizing compiler
	* Javascript is dynamic which makes it difficult to optimize for
* now can optimize the whole JS (not before; try-catch used to be a problem)
* getting feedback for specific optimizations
	* use mechanism of inline caches are used in V8 to make operations faster
	  and record type feedback
	* once bytecode is generated they also create a feedback vector for
	  collecting information when code runs
* if you use same method for structures of different types (e.g. array of
  numbers and array of strings), it can lead to polymorphic handling under the
  hood and making running it slower
* how about using builtin for summing (using reduce)?
	* same benchmark on Chrome up to 58; worse for integers (4.7x slower)
	* builtin reduce is written as Javascript that is more complex than
	  straight sum function (self-hosted)
	* hence need to optimize for them
* building a better builtin: The CodeStubAssembler
* Why not C++? 
	* ABI differences
	* deferred code
		* make checks to select between different paths (fast, slow); hard to
		  do in C++
	* GC handling of pointer types
	* tail calls
* How about assembly?
	* for a while they did this, but turned in a mess after a while
* CodeStubAssembler generates using TurboFan optimized assembly for each
  platform
* new results: consistent, but numbers slower than at the beginning (strings
  much faster)
	* reason: overhead of switching between functions (more expensive than work
	  inside)
* fixed by: inlines functions passed to reduce if they meet certain criteria
* Chrome 66: much faster across the board, but not completely consistent
* Take aways:
	* Design minimally and specifically
	* write idiomatic Javascript
	* use new features which allow you to express intent using JS builtins
	* measure and tune carefully (and chose the right benchmarks)


## Your algorithm isn't neutral: exclusionary UX and how to avoid it, Ivana McConnell

* inclusive is often not well defined (inclusive UX)
* inclusion needs to happen before user can try to complete the task
* inclusive definitions are always opositional ones: not to exclude X
* software creates communities: it's just common ownership and the best ones
  foster togetherness
* I am X user instead of I use X means we identify partly with it
	* hence code and design are critical becomes they enable these interactions
* algorithms are rulesets design by people (hence NOT neutral)
* exclusion: what do these experiences look like
	* Apple's Healthkit: cannot track reproductive health
	* Pure Gym UK: did not allow a woman Dr. to women change rooms
	* voice interfaces are useless for those who can't speak, have accent...
* exclusion is a decision: someone didn't see a problem; didn't stop or did  go
  ahead
* who *should* your product empower?
	* who does it empower? does it match up?
* Inclusive UX: how do we approach it?
	* not easy and don't expect it to be
* Bias: we all have it and need to address it
	* with inclusion is generally is not defined for each project
* Empathy has limits
* You need to clearly understand the problem and if you are the right person to
  be working on it (or making decisions)?
* Appoint the right decision-makers
	* need to involve other people; the ones that are affected
* ...and involve them from the start
	* if you get problem definition wrong, then what are you building?
* ...and trust them. Listen.
	* and respond in a meaningful way (even if it does not feel right to you)
* Build intentionally (NOT move fast and break things)
	* moving away from defaults
* Accept mistakes; it's how you react that matters!
* Inclusive != universal != neutral (it just has to include those for whom the
  solution is helpful)
* Inclusive UX: what success looks like?
	* Nextdoor: slow down when problematic posts are being written
	* Mobility Map
	* Wayfindr
* small choices matter; make them whenever you can (e.g. Add to Slack icon with
  darkskinned hand)
* Don't ask for what you don't need (gender, race, title...)


## When Old Meets New: Codebases, Ursula Sarracini

* how to write a modern web app in legacy codebase
* works on new tab page written with new web technologies they want to put into
  Firefox codebase
* Firefox is old and web moves fast; need to update technologies to stay
  relevant
* FF runs in a sandbox: 2 context
	* main process (parent process) can do privileged actions
	* content process which renders content but cannot do privileged actions
	* lots of code separation
* Shared code first challenge encountered
	* FF has many ways to import modules
	* but no way to import the same module in two different contexts
	* copy code? write a module loader?
	* used Babel to convert JSM to commonJS + webpack so we can import them in
	  both contexts
	* keep in mind: be ready for a mix of architectural patterns
* Multi-process Javascript
	* architect app using async messages passing, a common store between
	  process
	* FF has a builtin IOC
	* our own action dispatcher to attach Redux with the FF message manager
	* wrap existing code in new code to make it work
* Testing frameworks:
	* wnated to use Karma + Mocha + Chai
	* does not exist in FF - use old framework called Mochitests
	* Writing tests internally isn't enough - fix the existing tests in FF
	* spent a lot more time than expected to fix legacy tests
' Mocking
	* unit tests are obviously very important for your app
	* external dependencies in legacy codebase, affect the unit tests
	* mock out the external APIs that wouldn't be available int he context of
	  our unit tests
* Source control & issue tracking
	* not wanted to use hg for lots of bad reasons
	* their flow:
		* write git patch in our repo -> periodically node script copies over
		  files to FF repo -> use hg to write a patch -> push to FF
	* mirror bugs from Bugzilla to Github
		* important not to forget the way people are the most comfortable
		  filing issues
* Human & cultural
	* people didn't want bundles in the Firefox tree - but we needed React +
	  Redux to exist in the repo
	* had to commit the files to the tree (not ideal, but a compromise)
	* we had to write more JSMs to fit FF code style
	* out app wanted to be modulear - lots of small independent modules but...
	* FF gives lots of overhead to loading modules so we had to compromise
* Release schedule was a big issue (FF takes 8 weeks to ship an update) and
  they have 2 week milestones
  * lots of A/B tests, style updates, bug fixes, feature updates
  * can't afford to wait 8 weeks until people see updates
  * compromise: ship as an add-on to the browser and get a different release
	cycle
* Communication
	* lots of developers are set in their ways about the FF code
	* change our strategy - be less isolated - write code that integrates with
	  the existing code
	* join meetings, talk to engineers so they know what's coming, know who to
	  talk to about the legacy code
	* lots of conversations about data collection
* Know when to make the right compromises
* Be open about the changes the product is making to the legacy code
* Don't be afraid to introduce new tech & modernize the old code


## Let's save the internet: How to make browsers compatible with the web, Ola Gasidlo
* https://webcompat.com
* project for bug reporting for the web
* project then takes over of notifying websites, browsers


## Build bridges, not walls â€“ Design for users across cultures, Jenny Shen

* what is culture? Dimensions:
	* power distance
	* individualism
	* masculinity
	* uncertainty avoidance
	* long term orientation
	* indulgence
* Users were not filling in passport data (Netherlands)
	* added warning to form for names to match, but warning wasn't effective
	* more effective to charge for mistakes and notify them
* research local UI patterns (hamburger menu not used in China much; they use
  compass/discover menu item)
* start designs with longest translations first (or most complicated)
* localize copy means also localizing idioms (for example 1 is free)


## Thinking PRPL, Houssein Djirdeh

* pattern to use to make apps load fast
* Push Render Pre-cache Lazy-load (PRPL)
* rel="preload" as="script" - preload resources that are critical for user
	* best used for resources discovered much later
	* "as" used for different types of resources
* rel="prefetch" will load as soon as possible, but first what it needs for
  current page
* Webpack: preload-webpack-plugin
* preload works everywhere but Edge where it is in development
* HTTP/2 Server Push
	* the idea behind is that as browser makes request, we push assets we know
	  it will need with that document
	* you can push too much so if you are not careful you can cause more harm
	* be sure those assets will be used
	* it also ignores cache (pushing happens even if those assets are already
	  in browser cache)
* Service Worker - script running in background of your browser
	* npm: workbox-cli (for generating service worker)
* Worth precaching:
	* application shell (stuff without data)
* better to use workbox as dev dependency in build scripts so it always current
* service worker fetch strategies: networkFirst, cacheFirst,
	  staleWhileRevalidate, cacheOnly, networkOnly
* workbox wizard --injectManifest


## Fast. Simple. Accessible., Estelle Weyl

* [Slides?](https://estelle.github.io/concat/)
* Check: [CSS? WTF!](http://instartlogic.github.io/p/wtf/)
* nobody she talked to knew how radio button works (name attribute, radio group)
* shows how to effectively use HTML and specifically radio input to make
  dynamic accessible interface
* if you set display:grid on table, it is not read as table anymore by screen
  readers


## The Strategy Guide to CSS Custom Properties, Mike Riethmuller

* a bit like variables in preprocessors
* --custom-property in CSS
* custom properties can be used where properties are valid (inside of {})
* var() can be used where values are valid (value, shorthand, calc()... but not
  media rules)
* difference in scope (preprocessors are statically scoped; when rendered all
  are static)
* custom properties dynamically scoped so a subject to inheritance and cascade
	* can change for example in media query
	* can have different values in different parts of page
* global vs. local
	* by default scoped to selectors (local)
	* also inherited (kinda global)
	* global variables are almost always static
		* makes sense to still use a preprocessor for static variables so it is
		  clear when you read which values shouldn't be changed
	* perfectly ok to have locally static variables
	* find slides to see handling button
* don't be too clever
* strategy: change the value, not the variable (change value in media query,
  but use same variable)
* strategies for responsive design
	* if it changes, it is a variable
	* media queries should only be used for changing custom properties
	* separate logic from design (var statements tell us these are values that
	  will change)
	* the logic fold bellow which we only have design logic
* strategies for theming
	* capitalise global custom properties
* set custom properties with Javascript: node.style.setProperty(propertyName, value);
	* can also be used in style attributes
* use custom properties now!
	* postcss-css-variables (not the other ones)


## Remote device sign-in â€“ Authenticating without a keyboard, Tiffany Conroy

* everything in talk is contained in her blog post that will be linked at the
  end of her talk
* effectively like bluetooth pairing where you enter the code on device with
  friendly input method (where you are also already signed in)
* well, better than BLE pairing with some really interesting ideas (coming
  mostly from Google's implementation)
* [Details](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/remote-device-sign-in)


## Styled Components, Max Stoiber

* maybe it makes sense to do styling at the component level
* what if you wrote _actual_ CSS in Javascript? (first prototype)
* next version: use functions for conditional styling
* where styled-components come from
* basically story about [this](https://www.styled-components.com)
* supports all css, which gets parsed and then inserted in head of DOM
* worth looking into since it simplifies component use and remove context
  specific per-component classes


## Lighting talks

* a11y
	* quotation marks used in text change depending on language used for HTML
	  document
	* it also changes how screen readers read it
	* language influences date/number inputs, hyphenation...
* Linting
	* prettier: a better linter and automatic code fixer (eslint can do too?)
	* lint-staged: run lint only on changed files (so not overwhelmed on old big
	  projects)
* git bisect
	* git bisect start
	* git bisect bad master
	* git bisect good v4.2
	* git checks out commits through bisection and we need to tell if commit is
	  good or bad (with git bisect bad/good)
	* look into:
		* git bisect run npm test
		* git bisect skip
		* git bisect terms
		* git bisect replay


## Unlocking the power of SVG â€” SVGs beyond icons and illustrations, Sara Souiedan

* cropping, scaling and aspect ratio: SVG viewBox and preserveAspectRatio
	* the SVG viewport != viewBox
	* viewport defined by width and height of SVG root element
	* viewBox is only the part you see of (infinite) SVG: defines coord. system
	  browser will use for drawing
* browser support for object-fit/object-position is not great yet, but we can
  use SVG for this
	* <image xlink:href="..." width="100%" height="100%"></image> inside of SVG
	* problem missing alt attribute => add title element to SVG
	* problem: can provide only one images (need more for different
	  resolutions, density) => use foreignObject that includes for example
	  picture
* optimizing image sizes with SVG masks (so we can add transparency to jpeg)
* optimizing SVG delivery with...SVG
	* check video: looks interesting
* don't capitalize in HTML because of screen readers (they think its
  abbreviation)
* effect of rough paper created with two filters and no images
* conditional processing in SVG (providing fallbacks natively using SVG itself)
* if you have two inline SVGs on the page, then styles found in one will also
  be applied to the other one
