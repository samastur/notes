# PyCon 2016

## Wednesday - 1.6.

### Keynote - Cris Ewing
* CMFPlone created to improve usability of content management (of Zope)
* distinguishing idea was in-place page creation (create a page where you want it)
* history of Plone
* check out the bit about component architecture
* Diazo: creates xslt to change layout without needing to know xslt
	* can be used with other frameworks, but most powerful with Plone


### Write an Excellent Programming Blog - A. Jesse Jiryu Davis
* why?
	* share your expertise
	* meet fellow specialists
	* writing is thinking
* what?
	* likes 5 categories:
		* stories (something happened, this happened and I learned this lesson)
			* read: Glyph's Unyielding
		* opinions (thesis, point of evidence, response to likely objections, restatement of thesis)
			* don't attack people (for defence only)
		* how to (probably most common; steps to do it, but begin with motivation)
		* how something works (start: do you want to know? it does this and that...)
		* reviews (a bit dangerous; describe what it is and the experience you had, strengths and weaknesses and conclude what it is good for)
* who (will read it)?
	* finding your audience (not SEO)
	* aggregators (Planet Python...)
	* Weekly emails
	* this should be enough and specialists will find you
* improve your writing (practice, read, get an editor)	* when he writes he tries to emulate what he thinks made articles he likes effective
	* read words and ask yourself if what you read was effective or not in any case ask yourself how to improve it
	* get writing buddies with whom to share criticism
* when? (making time to write)
	* write infrequently
	* when you have something to say
	* or are inspired
	* write short things more often (like reviews)
* write together

### Anti-patterns for Diversity - Naomi Ceder
* slides: https://goo.gl/XqlbVH
* humans differ in endless number of ways
* diversity is a good thing (diverse teams are more adaptable, creative and profitable)
* there's not enough of it (diversity)
	* most efforts have come across as not moving the needle a lot or even going in reverse (we are losing more women than we should even just by comparing other industries)
* what about us?
	* we can be proud of what we have achieved so far, but we are not there yet and being accepted one week out of a year is not a good way of living your life
* why aren't we doing better?
	* sometimes what we do wrong is just as important as what we do right
	* what are the anti-patterns we have?
	* no matter how we've been excluded, we are all capable of excluding others
* we don't/can't see the problem (my fail with dextrism; seeing gender from both sides)
	* she didn't think of left-handed people years ago when she was equipping a new classroom
	* question your privilege (think again if you don't think you have one and listen to feedback from others); e.g. Naomi is a native English speaker
* Education system: lack of role models
	* look harder, interview and hire (twice as many people of color are graduating in CS as are hired)
* **we focus on diversity and ignore inclusion** (diversity is the mix of human variation, inclusion is getting that mix to work well together)
	* official "Diversity" numbers focus on intake (#RealDiversityNumbers)
* need to focus more on retention/promotion (do people feel included enough that they stay and grow?)
* we forget diversity has many dimensions (these dimensions can intersect in particularly grinding ways)
	* gender, race and economic status can combine with other issues to be deadly
* be aware, provide support (flexibility, safety, training...); same level to everyone might not be fair
* we don't think about the costs to the excluded
	* daily toxic environments
* how does your culture treat people who are different? (do you assume that everyone drinks? plays ping pong?...)
* we put the burden on the marginalised (call the woman|minority|... person to sort things out)
* take the lead to be an ally (or a co-conspirator even when there's no one marginalised around)
* exploitation is NOT inclusion (deviation from the norm will be punished unless it is exploitable)
* what we should do:
	* don't do "diversity" unless you mean "inclusion" (appreciate the benefits diverse people bring; respect the risks they take)
	* active outreach (the best way to convince people you are truly trying to be inclusive is to talk to them directly)
	* let people speak. Listen! (when in doubt, ask and respect their answers)
	* educate yourself (Google is your friend but do read critically)
	* we *can* do better (changing who we include will require changing what we do)


### Keynote - K Lars Lohn
* absolutely worth watching!
