Don Norman, Emotional Design for the World of Objects
-----------------------------------------------------
- scrolling: either you move text up, or window through which you look down =>
	two models of work (nobody owns up to decision on how to do it ;))
- no undo or discoverability on our new gestures systems; basically no feedback
- you can't be just web devel, or product devel, because experience moves across
	different devices and people expect the same experience
- we have to think of systems instead of single applications
- experience is important, but more important is memory, because it lasts longer
	=> so memory of experience is more important and you should design that
- we need to do with our apps is telling stories
- what makes good movie/story wonderful is not that every scene is great, but a good
	story and there is progress...story goes up and down => don't overload experience
	- because the greatest happiness comes after something bad
- hence as designers we need to think about time and experience through time
- you want to be challenged and fail, because it makes success more pleasurable
	(look at angry birds; you mostly fail and it's no intellectually challenging)
	- you fail at angry birds, but feel like you could succeed, so you try again and
	it's addictive
- the future is not completely in our hands, since other people build things like devices...
- cheaper 3D printing will change manufacturing of devices since more people will be doing
	it
- the most powerful tools won't be those we develop; but those our users will when given
	power to do so
- intention economy: will we design for what you intend to do in the future? (exciting and
	frightening)

Kelly Goto, Beyond Usability: Mapping Emotion to Experience
-----------------------------------------------------------
- we attach to devices because we attach memories to them
- think about spaces between experiences you're creating
- connections are experiences
- companies want addictive experiences (get request at least once a month)
	- you can't really create addiction; but you can understand rituals
- you can design experience that fit in seamlessly with rituals
	( functionality -> usability -> ritual)
	- important to understand them
- beautiful things tend to function better (Don Norman)
- it was found that surrounding context completely dominated the emotional 
	driving experience (mood you're in affects what your experience is)
- branding important because it will predispose people's reaction and experience with
	what you're creating (much better if they've been exposed to you)
- understanding how people live is necessary to get emotional side of value
- CHECK Kansei engineering

Bryan & Stephanie Rieger, Letting Go
------------------------------------
- for much of human history we have been on a quest for perfection + control
- this is about design in age of disruption
- the balance of power is shifting; we can no longer expect customers to interact
	with our creations in a linear, exclusive or predictable manner
- users will change experience and continue it after the end of what we built
- marketers: product "arrived" at society at about 50 million users
- the best design will set the stage, but stop short of fully defining the experience

Craig Mod, What is the Shape of the Future Book?
------------------------------------------------
- three constant design tasks: tame unfiltered data, produce quiet data (kindle: you experience
	content wholly) and corral data
- great design is born from nourishing habits
- "the more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood the other
	cities he had crossed to arrive there"

Frank Chimero, Oh God, It's Full of Stars
-----------------------------------------
- digital has presence, but not well defined (phantom pile); it still weighs (us) a bit
- digital stuff that we collect has potential - we mostly don't know what we can use it for,
	just have a feeling that we might
- commonplace book (learned people used to copy passages that they liked from books they read; kind of like
	tumblr of its day)
- by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality
	(robert parnton)
- => curation is authorship
- paul saffo: entering a third age when someone both produces and consumes in the same act
- missing 1 thing in commonplace book: architecture of serendipity
- finding and collecting is nice, but arrangement is what really adds value and we don't do it
	often (it requires 2nd pass)
- optimizing for 2nd pass (need to change 3 or our big decisions):
	- how we sort (so far: LATCH - find abbr)
		- tinker with arrangements of things so we can see "new" old things
	- how we move through time (instapaper pushes things to future)
		- CHECK photojojo.com
	- what media is supported (we need to be multimedia about this)
		- biblion ipad app best example of this (from ny library)

Dan Hon, Storytelling, Play and Code
------------------------------------
- some platforms let people mess around a bit (play) and some don't
- to make art with technology, one does not use it as a tool; one must understand it as a material.
	technology is not always a tool, an engineering substance... (tom armitage)
- platforms that make it easier to publish and play: heello, youtube, twitter, tumblr, wordpress
	- xtranormal site for easy making of cgi movies
- hard platforms for telling stories: facebook, google+
- none of these feel like stacks; none of them look like places where you can discover
	- we don't have authoring tools either (e.g. for telling multi-character story over a
		streambased media like twitter)
- what we lost when we started digitizing things; everything looks kind of same (websites...) and difference
	comes down to icon design
- this is not a metadata problem; it's a design/content/code problem

Kars Alfrink, The Transformers
------------------------------
- new ideas must use old buildings (jane jacobs)
- baarle-nassau/baarle-hertog = city that makes east/west berlin look normal (different parts in different
	countries)
- chine mieville: the city & the city (book) = fiction inspired by places like baarle
- the big question: how can we make society more resilient?
	(uk riots broke rules like you don't loot in your own neighborhood)
- problem with gamification is that it focuses on rewards instead of rules
- better way to use games to test new ideas (to see what sticks)
- need to counteract filter bubble (to hang with only like-minded people)
	- games as meeting place (chess in the park)
	- should be part of everyday life, everyday routine
- problem with urban games is that they don't scale (typically event based and costly to organize)
- bookcrossing.com (rules as memes)
- game Nomic (simplification of legal system, where games is making rules for game that once adopted need to
	be immediately followed)

Matthew Sheret, Pocket Scale
----------------------------
- trains: moving through space needs standardized time (time-space influence)
	- pocket watch is the first instance of people dealing with change brought by
		trains, telegraphs...new networks
- people SEE "THROUGH" each device to the SERVICE it represents (Mike Kuniavsky)
- totems = objects to remind people in dream state of realities real form
- oyster becomes an avatar of me, even though it's a simple chip; at last.fm they use
	oyster card to recognize person and to select radio station for him
- toys with rfid that trigger a selected movie; toys can become a multi-sensory
	experience

Kevin Slavin, Reality is Plenty
-------------------------------
- the fallacy of augmented reality is that eye not the brain is where things actually happen
- tamagotchi became real by behaving real; it's not how the thing looks that matters, it's what it does
