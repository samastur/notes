Ben Hammersley, The Flower, the Field, and the Stack
----------------------------------------------------
- we have to fight for beauty, not only to understand it, but also to make it beautiful in the first place
- are we, like Michaelangelo said only removing parts to reveal an inner beauty?
- we are not really thinking about how to make higher levels (use of twitter and also not use of it, how people are touched by it) beautiful
- what does media do to our children (repeated, constant concern)? we tend to deny them, but at the same time we talk about gamification and social networking and connectivity; we talk about attention
- on one hand we deny, but we also embrace the potential of tech to have a social effect
- we have to then come to terms to the fact that stuff we make for little screens actually change the world in some way
- so then how do we as community decide what to do? what values, messages do we put out as practitioners?
- things are changing so fast that some people, usually politicans and business leaders, have trouble keeping up
- we trusted our future to people who are confused by understanding our present
- we discovered on web that we are not randians, what we did is a communal affair; we feed off each other
- let's make our world more interconnected, more compassionate, more understanding, more human

Jenn Lukas, Cure for the Common Code
------------------------------------
- why haven't you learned what you would want to learn if you could?
- different problems: knowing where to start is daunting...
- breaks to formula: need help, resource, date, time and monetary value
- Girl Develop It - acros many cities now to help women learn coding in environment more friendly (less male)
- LOTS of sites that teach you coding (codingacademy...)
- we need problem based learning (you pose a problem to motivate students and look at tools to solve it)
- create a suportive environment for learning to give people confidence for learning

Scott Jenson, Beyond Mobile: Making Sense of a Post-PC World
------------------------------------------------------------
- default thinking: we apply new tech to what we did yesterday (radio plays on television)
- McLuhan: we look at the present through a rearview mirror: we march backwards into the future
- perspective is worth 80 IQ points (Alan Kay)
- apps are old school technology
- trends:
  1. app glut (everybody wants app; do we really want this on our phones; we are gardening our phones)
    (users are becoming a bottleneck because they are managing everything)
    - value > pain (needed to be successful); you CAN work on EITHER/BOTH so maybe you have to focus on
      reducing pain => triumph of the mundane
  2. size and cost reduction
  3. Devices leverage other platforms (nest termostat)
    - devices simpler and they offload some of that to other devices
- just-in-time interaction (interacting with evironment without having to install apps...); would be nice
  to react to environment when you're there
- what is our model crisis?
  - current model about software: buy, install and reuse
  - new model based on experience: discover, use and forget
- the problem: 'browser ghetto' (OS inside of OS)
- url bar became our command line (awesome bar and chrome equivalent)
- need discovery service: finding nearby devices with which you can interact
- basically QR codes without the bother;

Ariel Waldman, The Hacker's Guide to the Galaxy
-----------------------------------------------
- at the heart of anything good there should be a kernel of something undefinable (and if you can defin it, or claim to be ble to define it, then you kind of missed the point -- john peel)
- we are the etc. of the universe
- 95% of everything is invisible; 95% of everything is weak interaction design
- hackers created particle windchime, which was visualisation using sound and is now used at CERN for diagnostics
- planet hunters: project/site for looking at kepler data and looking for exoplanets and they have already detected a few

Seb Lee-Delisle, Pixels, Play and People
----------------------------------------
- lots of crazy projects

Lauren Beukes, Imagined Futures
-------------------------------
- those who can't imagine the future are doomed to fuck it up
- when imagining future you obviously have to consider the past, but it's also about running away with an idea
- universe is made out of stories not atoms (some poet), and we determine what we will make of them

Jason Scott, The Save Button Ruined Everything: Backing Up Our Digital Heritage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 1884 antipiracy ad for corn harvesters
- textfiles.com guy
- archive team is trying to save as much data as possible when companies close old sites like geocities
- if you take people stuff, you should ALWAYS make it possible for them to get their data

Tom Armitage, Making Friends: On Toys and Toy Making
----------------------------------------------------
1. toys as simulation: SimX games should be ToyX games because they are bad simulations, but good toys,
  because they make experimenting and changes, learning nice and fun
- doesn't implement stuff he doesn't want to explore!
2. toys as exploration of craft
- old miniatures
- utility is not the same as purpose; toys might not have a utility, but they do have a purpose
- we expose purpose and meaning through making
3. toyetics (coined by Gary Penn)
- seamful design (search for it)
- toys are incomplete without people and change when people start to interact with them
4. toys are finished
- seams are not rough edges
- don't leave cables dangling; good toy has a dense quality to it
- they are not prototypes
When you are building a toy, you have to imagine a player, think like that person. That's the big value of toys. The opposite of play is not work, it's obey (Joan Erikson).
making is playing
problem solving is converging on problem; toymaking is going from idea in directions

James Burke, Admiral Shovel and the Toilet Roll
-----------------------------------------------
- amazingly amusing talk
- rene descartes is guilty of everything but certainly on how we think
- working on project to teach young how to think inter-disciplinary
