Marty Neumeier, The Designful Company
-------------------------------------
- a designer is anyone who devises ways to change existing situations into preferred ones
- finding good choices is difficult, but deciding is easier (not the other way around)
- customers now want free, perfect, now (and not just two of cheap, good, fast)
- real competition comes from clutter, not other companies
	-types: product, feature, advertising, message, media
- a wealth of information builds a poverty of attention
	- harder to change mind, because we don't want to deal with it after we decided which
		brand represents something (e.g. iphone a smartphone)
- a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service or organization
- you have to be really different to be considered as a definition of something
	(otherwise you are just a me too brand)
- analytical tools don't work when judging radical ideas
- intuitive tool (you need to be good and different)
	- does poorly in tests
	- goes to market with difficulty
	- customers soon equate different with good

Brendan Dawes: Boil, Simmer, Reduce
-----------------------------------
- you have to collect as much stuff for inspiration as possible to get something good out
- simmer: play with things without considering if it can be done
	- should play more than we are; nobody will die
- we should put more of a thing that isn't noticed until it gets noticed (iphone scroll to top
	bounces and shows you there is nothing more up there)
- ponoko.com (create stuff on order)

David McCandless: Information is Beautiful
------------------------------------------
- TED Talk is more or less same as this talk
- data is a new soil
- play (more) with data, to find meaning and good representation
- what works: integrity, form, function and interestingness combined
- friends of getting idea: boredom, ignorance, bewilderment and frustration
	(signs that something is missing)
- @infobeautiful

Samantha Warren: The Power & Beauty of Typography
-------------------------------------------------
- true, but not much new

John Gruber: The Auteur Theory of Design
----------------------------------------
- thesis: the quality of any collaborative creative endeavor tends to approach to
	the level of taste of whoever has control

Hannah Donovan: Jam Session: What Improvisation Can Teach Us About Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- improvisation is a performance in the moment; a response to your immediate environment
- you do it with other people most of the time
- improvisation is shutting down self-censoring parts of brain and enhance self-expression parts
- to do well:
	- you need to be comfortable with tools you use (whatever they are)
	- structure & framework - you need to define some rules ahead of time that are
		respected and an overarching framework of what needs to be achieved
		(e.g. set of use cases...)
	- roles - each has its role and it pays to be very picky who yo work with
	- communication & expression - often marks we put on screen are most effective
		means of communication, not words (that's why prototyping etc. are so important)
	- trading parts - design equivalent is layer tennis (learn about how other people think)
- why
	- create new thought patterns, new structures, new ways to act...
	- improvisation has been at the heart of every popular music movement
- improvisation is key to creation of culture (read-write culture by lessig)
	- real-time web was needed for true improvisation

James Bridle: The Value of Ruins
--------------------------------
- the whole internet is in one shipping container (internet archive) - easy to steal
- we lost knowledge before (library of alexandria)
- wiki racing (who comes first to destination page from random page)
- everything should have a history button; we should always be able to look back
- @stml shorttermmemoryloss.com

Tom Coates: Everything The Network Touches
------------------------------------------
- with adding open data to web the range of things we can build is rising exponentially
- upgrades to the web of data:
	- social software
	- social networks
	- geolocation
	- real-time data
	- data visualisation
- the network extends to objects
- spimes (devices that give out location and ownership; redefines ownership, because you don't
	have to have it at home if you know where it is) and objects as service (renting washing machine)
- mujicomp (matt jones)
- weight uploading; more sites that could have access to it, more reason for weighting yourself
- sfpark.org (optimizing parking space by changing prices according to usage)

Merlin Mann: Kerning, Orgasms & Those Goddamned Japanese Toothpicks
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- important to figure out what to be nerdy about next (so you don't get obsolete)
