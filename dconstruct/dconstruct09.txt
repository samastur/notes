Adam Greenfield: Elements of Network Urbanism
=============================================
- ubiquitous computing seems like future after web
- networked urbanism = architecture, city and ucomputing?
- by the end of 2008 more than half the world's human population lived in cities
	=> when you consider humanity condition and impact on it, you have to consider urban context
`- more of a post-urban condition: slams, favelas are prevalent, not a new york city like places
- imagine that technology layered over such places, not modern (west) cities
- Gartner: by the end of 2012 networked sensors will account for 20% of non-video Internet traffic
	=> a very significant % of bits travelling primarily won't be a consequence of direct human action
- 1. transition: component -> resource
	- ipv6 is large enough that EVERYTHING can be addressable, potentially queryable and hence even scriptable
	 (a new set of eyes of querying state of components and act (up)on it)
- 2. transition: constant -> variable
	- nothing need be static/constant anymore; you can imagine a world of dynamic response to
		conditions elsewhere (streets that change direction in response to traffic in other parts of town)
- 3. transition: latent -> explicit
	- Everyblock collects local reports (police, health, fire...) and maps over city; this was always
		generated, but it was latent, hard to get out
	- you don't necessarily want to know all that information (can be scary); maybe it's better to live
		in kind of fog about it
- 4. transition: browse -> search
	- instead of encountering things at random, as you happen on them, you can do reach and find
		them (give me a restaurant in walking distance that doesn't have a line outside)
	- changes what it means to be enlightened, informed user of a city when you have a search
		organism that is radically democratized
- 5. transition: held -> shared
	- sharing information makes more sense now and you can contribute to world in an important, rich way
- 6. transition: expiring -> persistent
	- knowledge does eventually leave the world, but might not anymore if network will catch
		information (facts will remain)
	- one reason why big cities exist is a chance to start over with a blank slate; won't be so easy anymore
	- difficult to carry multiple masks
- 7. transition: deferred -> real-time
	- things get closer to real-time; to get conditions on real-time traffic data etc.
- 8. transition: passive -> interactive
	- becoming cocreators of a place from passive participants
	- everything we do has consequences that can change things for others (think queues)
- 9. transition: wayfinding -> wayshowing
	- used to be that cities were designed in a way to help you orient yourself (signage, maps,...)
	- if you have a device like sat-nav, that can get you from A to B step by step, then you begin
		to show your way around the world instead of find
	- great if you are stranger in a place, but McLuhan (preveri kako se napise) said every extension is also an amputation
	- what happens when technology fails, if that's everything you ever known
- 10. transition: object -> service
	- should be a talk in itself
	- city car share (zipcar, local bicycling schemes); cars mostly sit in parking lot, but this is changing when
		you can lease access and is more efficient; it's not an object anymore, it becomes a service
- 11. transition: vehicle -> mobility
	- when planning a route through space, don't think of as much about particular type of vehicle
- 12. transition: ownership -> use
	- Spotify: has all music and just set up a playlist; don't own the music itself
	- maybe I don't need to own things locally to make maximum use of them
	- maybe things might get closer to peak optimum use
	- he thinks we are moving out of consumerisms to something that isn't born yet, but is based on different
		economic assumptions
- 13. transition: schelling -> schoaling
	- clock in grand central used to be a schelling point -> where people meet when agree on meeting ahead of time (presernov trg)
	- you don't need that anymore: I'm here at <somewhere>, meet me <here>; converging on a vector of intention of be
- 14. transition: community -> network
	- neighbourhoods exists on a delicate balance of knowledge of people around you
		- small amounts of information is actually optimum for living together
		- building added a discussion board and in couple of months it broke building community
	- cities don't work like social networks; you encounter an other, somebody different and it is where
		interesting things happen; on SN you connect yourself to somebody that you have some sort of afinity
	- problem because it begings to homogenize city and might look a lot like suburbs
	- we should maintain for purely functional reasons some aspects of previous world
- 15. transition: consumer -> constituent
	- in every political sense have an opportunity to become cocreators, constituents of society, if we
		design it properly (that is different from city to city, country to country)
	- it's not likely to come out of technology secto\


Michael Migurski, Ben Cerveny: Let's See What We Can See/Everybody Online And Looking Good
==========================================================================================
- fascinating, but not transcriptable
- use lots of geographic approaches to presenting lots of data (google maps inspirations)
- physics of information: rules to map to dynamic representations (are coherent and rules
	become internalized; e.g. people are now familiar with google maps way of using maps-like
	data)
- sculpture in possiblity space
	- lots of different variables that need to be brought down to something that can be represented
		in lower-D space (timelines, size of circles...)
- tuning in patterns
	- allow users to tune in patterns (like commute or nightlife timeframes when displaying crime in city)
		check http://oakland.crime-spotting.org
- dimensional synesthesia (condition where you like hear a sound and can smell a certain scent)
	- like dynamic representations of audio


Brian Fling: What's Next? How mobile is changing design
=======================================================
- generation Z: born in the modern digital age. technology is infused at birth
	(iphone to them is what macintosh was to us)
	- they solve them problems using SN and make buying decisions collectively
- in less than five years, y+z generations might have more buying power than rest (??)
- is HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, XML and APIs the universal language of everything we'll describe?
- how mobile is changing design?
	- tweetie based desktop app on their mobile app (design first for more constrained environment?)
- do we design for medium or the context?
	- mobile design is about context
- the era of single context web is over; we have to think of design as a multi-faceted experience


Nathan Shedroff, Chris Noessel: Learning From Sci-Fi Interfaces
===============================================================
http://www.nathan.com/thoughts/MakeItSo.pdf (talk)
- scifi influences design in 3 ways:
	- expectation (setting it)
	- social context
	- proposed paradigm (wouldn't it be cool, if...)
- Expectation:
	- X-men pin display inspired army tool for creating 3D models of topography
	- sometimes expectations are difficult to let go (humanoid robots)
- Setting social context and responding to it
	- antropomorfizem (MS Bob, Clippy...) => tricky
	- sound is enough (easy to slap visualizations on, but difficult to do well because it raises expectations)
		- r2-d2 is endearing even without humanoid characteristics (doesn't look like or talk)
	- behavior can be enough (one-click at Amazon; knows enough about you to trust)
- Proposed paradigm influences us in 4 ways:
	- reminds us what we already know
	- inputs should know effective states of its users (mashing buttons is not a normal behavior)
	- showing us in new technology that we can use in current work (e.g. holography and size; more important being bigger)
	- intentional modality in gestrural interfaces (if actions have meaning, how do you deal with actions
		that shouldn't have meaning)
- it takes about 30 years for interfaces to move from sci-fi to mainstream
- not everything that works for movie audience works in real life (tom cruise arms got tired when filming
	minority report)


Robin Hunicke: Loving Your Player with Juicy Feedback
=====================================================
- defining juicy:
	- tactile
	- inviting
	- repeatable
	- real-time
	- emergent
	- coherent
	- small
	- delicate
	- fresh


August de los Reyes: Experience and the Emotion Commotion
=========================================================
- a whole new mind (pink) book => check it
	- the more choices we have, less rational are we about making them
- shift to experience economy (value experience over things)
- what is rule of products? or objects?
- m.minsky says emotional thought and rational thought are same (book: emotional machine)
- what are emotions?
	- look at james-lange theory => suggests it is a label we apply after we experience something
	- our autonomic nervous system are monitoring environement and elicits response to inputs (adrenaline
		shoots up...)
	- same physical stimulus can draw different conclusions (depending on context)
- system output > user input = magic
- august@surface.com


Russel Davies: Dematerialising A Web of Data
============================================
- we are getting real objects with digital identities
- also digital stuff being expressed in physical things
- we are moving past digital infatuation and analogue nostalgia
- The Nature of Technology by W.Brian Arthur (check book)
