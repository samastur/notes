Amber Case: Ambient Location and the Future of the Interface
------------------------------------------------------------
- we are all cyborgs because we all use external interfaces to act in spaces (or something like it)
- computers devices that are larger on the inside: we can take anything into them or out them without them getting heavier
- cyborg anthropology is part of anthropology
- Steve Mann, 1981: loaded with heavy "wearable" computing apparatus
- worked on changed reality (not augmented) - wanted to take bits away (censor reality)
- after a while started using it for more mundane uses (contextual notification system - remember to buy milk)
- Mann: computers should conform more to us (not having to hunch over keyboard)
- mouse: persistant architecture (everyone buys them so difficult for alternatives to prosper)
- calm technology: there when you need it and not when you don't (amplify your life)
    - actions as buttons
    - invisible interfaces
    - ambient notifications (lights turn on when you get home; off when leave)
- memoto (takes pictures all the time); created in Sweden
- CT: abstract away interfaces that can be (get location, time etc. from env)
- Making the invisible visible: example: maps of movement (take location every x interval and plot)
- Geologi: your phone will become a remote control for reality (uses for real-time location)
    - add anonymous messages to map that can be seen when being in neighborhood
    - real-time hyperlocal weather notifications
- mapattack.org (real-time life "pac-man")
- bringing static content to life
    - pinball machine database (notifications) ??
- OBSERVATION: a bit obsessed with serendipity
- locations isn't enough: I don't know enough about myself (have plenty of friends and a wife): Jon Lebovsky
- correlation of multiple datasets == meaning
- we have frictionless datga gathering, but not frictionless correlation
- the best tech is invisible: get out of the way and help people live their lives

Luke Wroblewski: Infinite Inputs
--------------------------------
- we are going to build on top of that revolutionary interface with software
    (Jobs on multi-touch in original announcement of iPhone)
- keyboard has a ton of utility that gets underutilized especially on web
- we have 30 years of tinkering with mouse-keyboard interfaces
- multi-touch move to direct manipulation
- Google has a multi-touch friendlier data picker (not just a desktop contorl shrinked to touchscreen as kayak does)
- each time new input devices comes out, there's a lot to learn
- even more challenging now when we have to design for both: indirect and direct manipulation
- new kinds of interfaces using: ambient light, gps, mic, accelerometer, camera...
- 2011: nfc, front-camera, gyroscope,...
- accel, magnetometer + gyro: 9-axis motion and orientation sensing
- Siri is an alternative- parallel interface to iOS
- smart stay: display and plays video as long as you look at phone (face recognition)
- we now have 13 input types to build on (mobile inputs)
- Kinect
- ultrabooks have many of the same inputs now
- Glass interesting because it has all sort of new input types (head nod, wink, putting glass on/off...)
- bluetooth LE: micro-location and low energy use (built in recent iPhones and high-end Androids); CHECK

Nicole Sullivan: Don't Feed the Trolls
--------------------------------------
- troll: people who SEEK conflict and feed on ATTENTION
- if mailing list discussion goes of the rails, release something interesting
- recognizing trolls (with examples):
    - jealous: I did everything you did, only five years ago and better
    - the grammar nazi: go back to school and learn to spell, then maybe someone will take your ideas seriously
    - biased troll: humans are subtly biased - pattern matching machines. We expect others who do what we do to be like us
    - scary troll: how long are you going to lead the web astray before you just disappear?
        - get support; ideally without feeding the trolls
- Tantek did the taxonomy of trolls (TrollTaxonomy on his wiki)
- nonviolent communication: a language of life (book; a bit hippie)
  crucial confrontations (Kerry Patterson...); more business like
- internal trolls: harder to identify because we like to believe we are not asshats; feeds on inattention
- Project Implicit: uncovers bias  (http://goo.gl/2601D or ID)
- change is made by simply non-judgementally *noticing* what things aren't right
- group IQ: does groups which outperform are the more diverse, especially by gender

Simone Rebaudengo: Great things are connected, but what will they actually talk about?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- funny and sad how most products about future look at it in really utilitarian way (utilitarian future)
- products are people too (Matt Webb)
- connectivity is a dsitinct moment in product life; its main goal is to be used (peaceful learning)
- disruptive realizations (products could compare on how much they are being used; peer pressure between products)
- the addiction of a product: could use of product change the product to want to be used more  (how would that look like?)
- toaster: ubiquitous, anonymous and stereotype of connected products
    - a toaster pleasure comes from making toast
    - if connected to others, is it used a lot; what can it do about it?
        - need to know, needs to sense and needs language to communicate
    - use toaster and other start to wiggle levers to be used
- what can it do to subtly be used more? could it use other objects or say about owner to others for support?
- what if others interested in it could reach it?
- drastic choices: find another owner; become unbearable or sustainable suicide
- hosted toasters: could get picked up if not used enough so people started making parties to have them used enough
- what if really a product would be owner of itself?

Sarah Angliss: Tech and the uncanny
-----------------------------------
- book about radio: Haunted media (look it up!)

Keren Elazari: The Heroes and Anti-heroes of the Information Age
----------------------------------------------------------------
- www.k3r3n3.com
- the only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible
- people who can manipulate technology have the power today (me: not quite)
- stuxnet changed the world: first cyberweapon written in one part of the world that caused destruction in completely different
- crypto party: local gatherings to learn how to use crypto and exchange keys

Maciej Ceglowski: Fan is a Tool-Using Animal
--------------------------------------------
- check video/slides for really powerful use of tags (don't strip punctuation!)
- completely awesome example of fanfic community at work
- fans are SO NICE
- fans fight censorship! (often the first victims of it)
- fans fight for privacy (not ashamed of what they are doing; but pseudo/separate identity gives them freedom and demonstrate you can have a healthy communitylike that)
- fans never sold out; they transgress
- fans improve our culture (tv shows suck less than they used to because the fandom picking stuff apart made us more sophisticated)

- social is not a syrup, not even a noun (real community are people who have a long memory and history)
- don't make it too easy (you have to be committed to start contributing; bad interfaces protect from drive-by comments)
- stop futzing with it (if it's good, leave it; e.g. LJ limited number of avatars user could use which were used as a form of communication)
- shut up and listen (they may be using in ways you are not familiar with)
- breakups are hard (they won't return easily)
- fandom changes lives (a meaningful part of lives of many)

Dan Williams: Unexpected Item in The Bagging Area
-------------------------------------------------
- pervasive media studio (sounds like a place we need in Slovenia; CHECK OUT)
- anticipatory design science (designing solutions for problems that are not quite ready to be solved)
- Whole Earth Catalog by Stewart Brand
- millions of mobiles made everything that they are built out of very cheap (keyring with 720p camera rings)
- manifesto for CCTV filmmakers (making movies with CCTV only cameras)
- problem: companies assume algos for recognizing faces and moods are accurate; they aren't
- not sure he whishes to accept all technologies we create
- someone created makeups and haircuts to confuse face recognition algos/libs
- critical engineering (search for this term!)
- when we create tech that want to create sense of wonder, we create egotistical stuff

Adam Buxton: 'Is My Laptop Ruining My Life?'
--------------------------------------------
- funny, but nothing really to jot down
