# dConstruct 2014 - Living with the Network

## Warren Ellis: A Cunning Plan
* history matters
* difficult to make notes, but fun to listen


## Georgina Voss: Tethering the Hovercraft
* observed that it's the last part of delivery (bringing to the house) that is main point of friction, unhappiness
* it's amazing long, complicated journey that ordered stuff goes through and then at the very end of it delivery often fails
* Blonsky device: facilitating birth of a child with centrifugal force
    * never produced for very good reasons
    * patent been cited 14 times; even by NASA
* some ideas don't travel even when they are good: forceps
    * forceps for assisting with child birth (invented by people that came from 5 generation of doctors)
    * it was one of the way for them to differentiate from other doctors and they didn't want others to know about it
    * carried in large box carefully to give impression of complicated device
    * blindfolded mother so it wouldn't see the device and made other noises (bells!)
    * eventually secret leaked out, but at that point other doctors invented similar solutions
* VX: nerve gas created by British government which was released as patent in 1975
    * Sunday Times reported about this
    * it had a very neutral name, which would be difficult to find if Sunday Times didn't reveal it
* in history of technology worries about moral harms get wrapped in
* Comstock promoter of anti obscenity law and became US Postal Inspector enforcing obscenity law he helped pass
* consequence of law was that anatomy books couldn't be send by post and neither could things like condoms so US soldiers in WWI went to war without condoms and 70% of them coming back were infected with STD (infecting then others and having huge knock-off effect of one piece of legislation)
* if you start putting limits on what information can be published/public, then it effects network itself which will try to bend to get access to that information
    * e.g. searching for doctor to perform abortion was done by women not by asking people near to them; instead they contacted people less connected to them because that helped covering tracks
* condoms were reframed as disease reduction products (after WW to reduce effect of STDs) so that they would not be considered obscene (technology is still the same)
* living in the network is not necessary about frictionless experience, but understanding where those frictions are and how to navigate them


## Clare Reddington: Memes for Cities
* playable city: launched 3 years ago (thinking about new experiences you can have in city)
* a city is more than a place in space, it is a drama in time (Patrick Geddes, 1904)
* town planning is "..the art of relationships" (Gordon Cullen)
* play is making longer lasting and stronger bonds
* utrecht travel accelerator (slide next to stairs)
* sydney harbour bridge picnic
* play can give a sense of agency and a feeling of being part of network (to counter sense of lethargy often felt by people living in cities)
* inspired by these projects, but doesn't feel they are playable cities anymore
* playable city: using existing infrastructure to make them fun, playful (e.g. swing added to bus stop)
* use city as a canvas for play; as a set you could never afford
* 2.8hourslater.com (the zombie street game)
* Hello lamp post (Bristol)
* no point in creating something that is not great on first use (asked themselves all the time what are we competing with?)
* shadowing this years winner of playable city awards (as you pass traces of those that came before you are animated as shadows)
* inclusivity is at the heart of playable city; it requires audience and that audience should need a special technology to be able to participate


## Aaron Stroup Cope: Still Life with Emotional Contagion
* it's not clear what happened to the project; it's difficult in 2014 not to feel negatively about living in the network
* why are we still doing this?
* anil dash: the web we lost
* brick from bin laden's compound in 9/11 memorial (proxy object for what happened); what's it supposed to represent (schadenfreude?)
* when arts funding in eu was cut, an archive chucked out 30k objects (why didn't they ask its community to store it; would still be better even if some of it was saved)
* the street find its own use for things (William Gibson); "by design"?
* the crazy thing about opportunity is that it is no guarantee of anything
* open street map: a promise realised for network; everything we wanted (bottom up open project, free to users; has enormous suite of tools that find ways into other projects)
    * patient; just sitting there waiting to be used
    * in service of maps; which are one of the oldest tools of power we have
    * it's improving, but hasn't taken (you'd expect people to crawl all over it)
* opportunity hackers (intelligence services): paid all day to tinker and think about opportunities to use
* web did pretty well in giving us all change to speak publicly
* we have always been at war with the past
* we have started to apply a measure of success that was a leaderboard
* do we start to warp the underlying conceptual (infrastructure) network if we see the world as nothing more than being seen right now? <facebook> would like nothing more than for people seeing in right now
* recall has always been a power dynamic (the right to literacy; notion of public library; broadcasting rights...)
    * the ability to see in the past has not been an opportunity open to all people
* studies to find drugs for deleting memories (to treat PTSD, but would be foolish to think use would stop there)
* we never before (at this scale) had ability to shift time
* the right of return (there's a difference between access and access at time of your own choosing)
* web is in a way document based network; a stack of files pointing to each other
* designing tools, creating things with intention to remember
* the rhetoric about memes and experience should be considered harmful (it's not always about the moment)
* what if you didn't have to bring your phone out so you could safe memories of what you've seen in museum (working on tool that would help you store things you've seen in your account)
* asserting patience
    * a lot of ideas don't experience hockey stick growth and they die which is a shame
    * people are busy; they should have an opportunity to come back to a service, an idea because they may not be able to understand at time when they first encounter it
    * how do you build a service that runs itself? so it can run even if you move on so that we wouldn't be strip-mining history of web
* Thomas Picketty was able to make his argument with facts that went far back!
    * speaking up, being part of conversation is not oversharing (NSA is a social problem, not technological)
    * he is concerned we are forgetting that


## Brian Suda: Humans Are Only a Self-driving Car's Way of Making Another Self-driving Car
* when we started developing agriculture and breeding home animals, we started experimenting with network, but didn't really understand what we were doing
* Tom Standage (the victorian internet) recent book Writing on the wall: social media the first 2000 years
* republic of letters from 17th to 19th centuries is also a kind of predecessor of our social networks (who's who, who to follow...)
* in less than a generation we went from year and half to take message to India and back to 30 seconds
* we live in a world of killer robots and did not introduce legislation because we walked slowly up the ramp
* we don't actually understand living in the network; maybe we are frog boiled alive
* social media advice: When to Wish Happy Birthday?
* 1837 postal reform: instead of custom calculation of the price of postage they came up with post stamps that you could pre-buy and use (profitable on average)
* IoT: a lot of them die without "mothership"
    * do we own the devices we pay for?
* VCR-cat-feeder vs. IoT today; later just notify you (pester) and not really solve the problem
* smart defaults: wifi bulbs compared to light that turns on when it's dark (later cheaper and works better for most)
    * most products aim too high; they need to focus on everyday and mundane
* the right to be forgotten (EU right)
	* you can enforce it today because Google is physical entity that has to follow laws
	* maybe in future we won't be able to do this if it will be more distributed (bitcoin)
* IoT: basically Wifi, bluetooth, NFC and infrared


## Mandy Brown: Hypertext as an Agent of Change
* Tycho Brache had 2 (!) astronomical tables that he could use to spot the error in prediction of Saturn-Jupiter conjunction
* with print each copy was the same and did not introduce new errors; typographical fixity is a basic prerequisite for the rapid advancement of learning (source: Eisenstein)
	* new versions could improve instead of deteriorate
* hypertext opens collaboration wider than it could ever be before (example: Wikipedia)
* lots of hopeful and positive views of what our hypertext media could be, but mostly isn't
* there is no neutral ground in technology; there is no safe place to stand
* * turned more realistic in last third, but no new insights; a call to action for positive change


## Anab Jain: Valley Of The Meatpuppets
* playmobil checkpoint set!
* watching and being watched is an integral part of our lives
* Dan Williams: Snowden 2014 calendar
* problems Snowden exposed seem to be too big to grasp
* how are we controlled today?
* meat puppet: person invited to internet discussion solely to influence
	* also use to think about ways in which we are co-opted to behave like meat puppets in our lives
* how we humans negotiate our own agency while living within wholly mediated network
* people are really disturbed about privacy, but are we really disturbed by the opposite? we are valued in aggregate
* http://getpiper.com: instead of the entire space being private, there are going to be public areas in your home
* Google's glass rules of engagement: beginning to define our behaviour engagment which Anab thinks is a profound change to old manuals
* Texas company pays people to install cameras on their cars to take plates of other cars so they can find cars that need to be repossessed
* Tiltor (tiltor.com): offering rewards to people to disperse crowds (anti-protest tool)
* APCO: second largest lobby firm in USA that was key to Navindra Modi's make-over
	* created the Indian "Davos"
	* astro-turfing
* people make decisions as groups
* the vectorial class: you play with the data, we control the metadata (McKenzie Wark)
* invisible wars over autonomy will become a leitmotif of the 21st century
* reclaim our right to reimagine and reshape the world we live in
* design should be judged not only by the problems it solves, but by the problems it creates. (paraphrased from Lebbeus Woods)
* www.iotacademy.org (CHECK)
* reclaim the tools of perception
	* from astroturfing to critical intervention
* hope won't do it, it takes anxiety


## Tom Scott: 2030
* no notes


## Cory Doctorow: Information Doesn't Want to be Free
* most people trying to earn money in creative arts will fail and that was always so
* arts are foundationally non-economic activities
* our priority shouldn't be to preserve business models
* 3 laws:
	* anytime puts a lock on your stuff and doesn't give you key, they didn't put it there for your benefit
	* fame won't make you rich, but you can't make it without it
	* information does not want to be free
* in information age you can only be free if you have a fair access to information
* ran out of battery
