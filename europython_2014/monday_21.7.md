## One year of Snowden, what's next? (Constanze Kurz)
* overview of what we learned about global surveillance since Snowden's leaks
* we have to conclude that democratic oversight failed
* study of Privacy International: Surveillance Industry Index ([source](https://www.privacyinternational.org/sii/))
	* at least 388 companies worldwide that sell 97 different surveillance technologies
	* passive and offensive hacking tools
* these companies usually don't take human rights as concern or potential for technology misuse
* in rare case of export restrictions they export from a different country to work around those
* surveillance priorities do not have much to do with terrorism:
	* EU institutions, eighty embassies worldwide
	* heads of foreign governments
	* G20 meetings, OPEC, World Bank
	* companies (Petrobas)
* ideology: "if you're looking for a needle in the haystack, you have to get the haystack first" (Deputy Attorney General James Cole, July 2nd 2013)
* US National Intelligence budget: 52.6 billion (probably more because some of it is part of other military spending)
* TAO (tailored access operations): exploits against Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS...
	* grey market for vulnerabilities and malware (it would not be so big if the surveillance community wasn't spending so much on buying)
* success? modest (White House panel 2014 report)
* targeting Tor:
	* publications from July expose data collection explicitly targeting Tor users
	* parts of the search pattern code used in XKeyscore
	* data traffic to and from Tor servers
* they are challenging GCHQ snooping on article 8 of human rights convention in the European court of human rights (as GCHQ itself has helpfully suggested)
* The NSA: the only part of the government that actually listens :-P
